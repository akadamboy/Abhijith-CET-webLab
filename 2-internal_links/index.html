<p>Internet is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks. It allows exchange of information between two or more computers on a network. Thus internet helps in transfer of messages through mail, chat, video & audio conference, etc. It has become mandatory for day-to-day activities: bills payment, online shopping and surfing, tutoring, working, communicating with peers, etc.</p>
<p>Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client. </p>

<h2 id="csc">Client/Server concepts</h2>
<div  style="text-align:auto;margin:20px,0px,20px;padding:30px;">
<p>A client-server network is the medium through which clients access resources and services from a central computer, via either a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet. A unique server called a daemon may be employed for the sole purpose of awaiting client requests, at which point the network connection is initiated until the client request has been fulfilled. <p>

  <li><b>Client:</b></li><p>a Client is a computer capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers</p>
  <li><b>Servers:</b></li><p>Server is a remote computer which provides information (data) or access to particular services.</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="cwa">Components of Web Application</h2>
<div  style="text-align:auto;margin:20px,0px,20px;padding:30px;">
   <ul>
    <li><b>UI/UX Web Application Components –</b></li><p> This includes activity logs, dashboards, notifications, settings, statistics, etc. These components have nothing to do with the operation of a web application architecture. Instead, they are part of the interface layout plan of a web app.</p>
    <li><b>Structural Components –</b></li><p> The two major structural components of a web app are client and server sides.</p>
     <li><b>Client Component - -</b></li><p>The client component is developed in CSS, HTML, and JS. As it exists within the user’s web browser, there is no need for operating system or device-related adjustments. The client component is a representation of a web application’s functionality that the end-user interacts with.</p>
    <li><b>Server Component -</b></li><p> The server component can be build using one or a combination of several programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .Net, NodeJS, PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails. The server component has at least two parts; app logic and database. The former is the main control center of the web application while the latter is where all the persistent data is stored.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Web Content</h2>

<div id="twc" style="text-align:auto;margin:20px,0px,20px;padding:30px;">
   <ul>
    <li><b>Blogs -</b></li><p> Blogging is an invaluable tool for driving visitors to your website, and building awareness about you and your brand.<br>

Generally written from a more personal and informal point of view than content assets, a blog is a great way to connect with readers. It is the perfect vehicle for providing them with information that not only answers a question or solves a problem, but also helps to establish you as a trusted authority on the topic.<br>

Blogs are also a great way to keep your web content fresh, enabling you to post new content on a regular basis and helping you continue to rank in SERPs (search results).
</p>
    <li><b>Content assets –</b></li><p> This broad category of web content includes collateral and similar resources you have already invested in and can now repurpose to help draw visitors to your website.<br>The goal is to extend the value of these assets by using them across different digital media and channels. The content can be broken up into smaller pieces and distributed in new ways, such as via blog posts, tweets, video clips, email blasts, search engine ads, and other channels.</p>
     <li><b>Calls to action -</b></li><p>A call to action (CTA) is a prompt designed to get your website visitor to take some immediate action, such as make a purchase or get more information.</p>

    <li><b>Landing pages -</b></li><p> Landing pages are destinations — the web pages where visitors are sent when they click on a hyperlink, such as a search engine result, a social media ad, a CTA, or a special offer on your website.</p>

	
    <li><b>Testimonials -</b></li><p> One of the best ways to appeal to prospects and build credibility is with relatable success stories from their peers. That is what makes customer testimonials such valuable web content.</p>

<li><b>Video & audio content -</b></li><p> With the ability to embed video and audio clips so that anyone can view and listen without leaving the webpage, digitally recorded media are increasingly popular web content tools. It is a great way to offer content such as how-tos, webinars, podcasts, and seminars.</p>

<li><b>Visual content -</b></li><p> According to the Social Science Research Network, 65% of people are visual learners. So, it makes good sense to incorporate visual web content into your website.</p>

 <h1 id=http>Overview of HTTP</h1>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.</p>

<h2 id=httpreq>HTTP request</h2>
<p>
An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server.

To make the request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the information needed to access the resource. The components of a URL explains URLs.
A correctly composed HTTP request contains the following elements:<br>

    <br>A request line.<br>
    A series of HTTP headers, or header fields.<br>
    A message body, if needed.<br>

Each HTTP header is followed by a carriage return line feed (CRLF). After the last of the HTTP headers, an additional CRLF is used (to give an empty line), and then any message body begins.
</p>
<h2>HTTP response</h2>
<p>
HTTP responses

An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. The aim of the response is to provide the client with the resource it requested, or inform the client that the action it requested has been carried out; or else to inform the client that an error occurred in processing its request.
An HTTP response contains:

    A status line.
    A series of HTTP headers, or header fields.
    A message body, which is usually needed.

As in a request message, each HTTP header is followed by a carriage return line feed (CRLF). After the last of the HTTP headers, an additional CRLF is used (to give an empty line), and then the message body begins. </p>

<h1 id=dyn>Generation of Dynamic webpage</h1>
<p>
A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
<br><br>
A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.
<br><br>
<center><img src=dynamicwebpage.jpeg.png width=800 height=400></center>
<br><br>
A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server.
<br><br>
DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.

<h1 id=appserver>Application Server</h1>
<p>
An application server is a server that hosts applications.[1]

Application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers. An application server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them.
<img src="applicationserver.jpeg" width=450 height=225 align=right>
An application server framework contains a comprehensive service layer model. It includes a set of components accessible to the software developer through a standard API defined for the platform itself. For Web applications, these components usually run in the same environment as their web server(s), and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages. However, many application servers do more than generate web pages: they implement services such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing, so developers can focus on implementing the business logic.[2]

In the case of Java application servers, the server behaves like an extended virtual machine for running applications, transparently handling connections to the database on one side, and, often, connections to the Web client on the other.[citation needed]

Other uses of the term may refer to the services that a server makes available or the computer hardware on which the services run.

<h1 id=websec>Web Security</h1>
<p>Web security is also known as “Cybersecurity”. It basically means protecting a website or web application by detecting, preventing and responding to cyber threats.Websites and web applications are just as prone to security breaches as physical homes, stores, and government locations. Unfortunately, cybercrime happens every day, and great web security measures are needed to protect websites and web applications from becoming compromised.
The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the continuously expanding reliance on computer systems, the Internet[2] and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary world, due to its complexity, both in terms of political usage and technology.[3]
